1)

When doing the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, I found the level of easiness to be the same for both.

In terms of readability, I found Pandas to be better because when outputting data it is more informative with labels, making it easier to understand.


2)

Running time of pivot_months_pandas function:   16.9 ms ± 703 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)

Running time of pivot_months_loops function:    483 ms ± 29.7 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)

pivot_months_pandas function is faster and this difference can be explained by the underlying data structure.

The Pandas function is based on NumPy arrays, which are arrays based on the C programming language, whereas the
pivot_months_loops function is a Python function using Python arrays, which requires greater overhead in
terms of memory than C. Therefore, we see a faster run time in the Pandas function.
