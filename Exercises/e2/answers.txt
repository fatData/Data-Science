1)The equation of a best fit line is y=mx+b which is represented by the our equation
y = data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept. This equation returns an object of type Series which holds the generated y-values which are used with existing x-values to plot the regression line. 

The data['timestamp’] are the x-values, fit.slope is the rate of change in dog ratings as months go by and fit.intercept is the y-intercept.2)

It produces a fit line on the graph because the fit.slope and fit.intercept values are calculated based on our dataset.

The created_at and timestamp values are paired correctly because they represent the same values with the same indexes, but in different formats.
